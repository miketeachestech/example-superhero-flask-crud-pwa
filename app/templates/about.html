                This website is a simple example of how web applications work using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong>. 
                It demonstrates how websites can store and manage information using a <strong>database (SQLite)</strong>, allowing 
                users to <span class="text-warning">add, edit, and delete superheroes</span>. 
            </p>

                Each superhero is stored with important 
                details like their real name, alias, universe, and image, and they can have connected to them. 
                This is an example of a <span class="text-warning">one-to-many relationships</span> in <strong>databases</strong>, 
                where one superhero can have many powers. <strong>Flask</strong>, a lightweight web framework, 
                makes it easy to <span class="text-warning">handle user requests, interact with the database, and 
                display dynamic web pages</span>.

                Beyond basic functionality, this project introduces key <strong>real-world programming concepts</strong> like 
                <span class="text-warning">form validation</span> to prevent errors when adding data, <span class="text-warning">file uploads</span> for 
                superhero images, and <span class="text-warning">security measures</span> like <strong>CSRF protection</strong> to prevent unauthorized 
                form submissions. It also utilizes <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, a popular CSS framework, to enhance the user 
                experience and make the website <span class="text-warning">both functional and (somewhat) visually appealing</span>.
